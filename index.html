							<h2>Don't worry, this is not a biography</h2>
							<p>
								To accurately outline the competencies and skills I’ve acquired, it’s important to share some context. 
								I moved to the U.S. from Jamaica in 2018. Growing up, I spent most of my time in FL Studio and recording studios, creating music. 
								Long story short, I decided not to rely solely on music as my source of income, so I needed to develop another skill. 
								My initial goal was to find a skill that could help me become an internet entrepreneur—something that would allow me to earn USD from anywhere. 
								The potential seemed worth any challenge, especially as the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology. 
								Since I had taught myself everything about making music—from chords and rhythm to scales and chord progressions—I figured I could also teach myself programming. 
								In this blog, I’ll outline each project I’ve worked on, its purpose in my life, and what I’ve learned from the journey.

							<h2>Tic Tac Toe (C++) 2019</h2>
							<p>
								I started with C++. Genius me thought, "If you’re serious about pursuing this, you should start with the <b>HARDEST</b> language you can learn." 
								What I didn’t anticipate was the sheer amount of time it would take—or the most obvious step: planning a project I was genuinely passionate about. 
								To test myself, I decided to build a simple tic-tac-toe game. The process turned out to be torturous.
							</p>
							<p>
								Every day, I would wake up dreading the flood of error messages—red text, syntax errors, and the ever-present impostor syndrome. 
								Back then, even minor errors could stump me for two to three days, and one issue had me stuck for almost a week. 
								In hindsight, none of these were particularly significant problems. Most of the time, it was just compile errors, syntax mistakes, or configuration issues. 
								For instance, I had no idea how to correctly configure the compiler, organize my <code>.cpp</code> files, or even understand what <code>PATH</code> or environment variables were. 
								I didn’t know how to properly use Code::Blocks, and the syntax errors were endless. It was a brutally steep learning curve.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the end, I never fully got the game working. 
								You could play it, but if someone won or lost, the program would keep prompting players for more moves instead of ending the game.

							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<p>
								There were both positive and negative aspects to how I approached learning C++. 
								The main thing I could have done better was to choose a project I was passionate about—something slightly beyond my current skill level. 
								Granted, I was a complete novice at the time, and this was when I was 19. 
								Still, even small optimizations in my DAW or computer setup could have been incredibly helpful back then. 
								I was still making music at the time, and the software I used could be pretty resource-intensive. 
								For example, I remember having to upgrade my RAM to keep up. 
								Perhaps creating a VST or working on a project that tackled a real problem in my life would have made the process far more enjoyable.
							</p>
							<p>
								Despite the challenges, I did manage to learn some foundational programming paradigms during this time—loops, variables, and functions. 
								But, oh, I had so much more to learn.

							<h2>Instagram Scraper (Python) 2020</h2>
							<p>
								Eventually, I decided that C++ wasn’t the right fit for what I wanted to accomplish. 
								By this point, I had finally started thinking in a more project-oriented way, and the first thing I wanted to learn was web scraping.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the time, I had a unique opportunity to explore <i>prospects</i> in the cannabis business. 
								A friend of mine was shipping products from Jamaica, and we were on good terms. 
								I figured that if I could gather data from social media, 
								I could build a program to profile individuals based on their location, ethnicity, job, etc., and predict whether I should reach out to them. 
								Let’s be honest: people share way too much information on social media.
							</p>
							<p>
								I used Beautiful Soup and programmed a bot to search specific hashtags like #bongs, #high, #420, #thc, and #smokebreak. 
								The bot would filter posts based on locations near me, assuming those users at least frequented areas in my vicinity. 
								It then generated .txt files of usernames that had interacted with the posts—whether through positive comments, tags, likes, etc. 
								Finally, it identified the most frequently recurring usernames across multiple posts. 
								I thought it was a clever algorithm at the time. However, it had a major flaw: it only found users who were highly engaged with cannabis-related content, not necessarily people who were interested in acquiring.
							</p>
							<p>
								The project was also clunky and inefficient. 
								I didn’t know about JSON dictionaries, databases, or classes, so my code was verbose, difficult to maintain, and completely lacked quality. 
								It was so slow and messy—scaling was NOT a possibility.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the script did generate a few leads, they weren’t enough to cover recurring expenses like gas or groceries, let alone bills. 
								Luckily, I was staying with my sister and didn’t have many financial responsibilities. 
								However, I couldn’t think of any improvements (ridiculous right?) to increase the chances of finding better leads, so I eventually called it quits. 
								Occasionally, I’d still run the script when I opened my laptop, but I had no real expectations from it.

						<div class="inner">
							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<p>
								From this project, I learned HTML and Beautiful Soup, and I also got my first experience with Selenium. 
								It was my introduction to web automation, and I gained a solid understanding of how to navigate it. 
								I even learned how to use PyCharm—which I quickly fell in love with (what a lifesaver).
							</p>
							<p>
								That said, the program was far from reliable. Back then, I didn’t know about <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> statements, which made handling errors inherently bad. 
								I was determined to make the most reliable program ever (ha!), but as you can imagine, this led to premature optimization and impossibly verbose code. 
								Fixing functions became a nightmare because the entire script was crammed into one <code>.py</code> file with nearly 1,000 lines of code. 
								Just thinking about it now is painful.
							</p>
							<p>
								I spent more time than I care to admit rewriting sections of the code. 
								Errors were so challenging to address that I often dreaded running the program at all. 
								The lack of structure and organization meant that debugging was an exhausting ordeal. 
								Looking back, I realize how naive it was to think I could avoid mistakes as a beginner. 
								Mistakes are an inevitable—and essential—part of learning.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the most valuable lessons I took away from this project was the importance of writing code that is both succinct and efficient. 
								Trying to do too much (not isolating functionality) without proper knowledge or planning just made everything harder for me.

							<h2>TinderBot (Python) 2020</h2>
							<p>
								Alright, I’ll admit, this one is a bit embarrassing, but hey—I guess I was just a typical young man (ha ha). 
								After chatting with a friend, I realized Tinder could open up a whole new range of <i>opportunities</i>. 
								There were a lot of <i>questionable</i> things going on at the time, but oddly enough, that realization was all I needed. 
								Having learned Selenium, I figured this was the perfect project to put my skills to the test.
							</p>
							<p>
								To my surprise, this turned out to be the most profitable script I’ve written so far. 
								It wasn’t anything groundbreaking, but I was seeing around $800 to $1,000 in profit during my best weeks. 
								That’s what really kickstarted things for me. 
								The key was leveraging the fact that many Tinder users openly mentioned smoking—or their interest in <i>acquisition</i>—in their bios. 
								Using regular expressions, I was able to determine whether someone mentioned smoking in a positive light and automate the bot to swipe right on those profiles. 
								I then handled the conversations manually.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the smarter features I implemented was a function that parsed the profiles for social media accounts. 
								For example, it could recognize labels like “Instagram: @crazywomanontinder54,” extract the username, and send the information to my phone. 
								I would then cold text them directly.

						<h2>What I Learned</h2>
						<p> 
							This was where my problem-solving mindset truly began to take shape. 
							I discovered the debugger (WHOO!) and immediately became far more efficient in identifying and fixing issues. 
							By this point, I had also learned a bit about JSON dictionaries and implemented try and except statements, which drastically improved the reliability of my code. 
							I even started experimenting with classes, though I was still relying on text files initially.
						</p>
						<p>
							At some point, I rewrote a significant portion of the code to make it much more efficient—a task I’m not particularly proud of in hindsight, as it reflected how often I had to revisit and refactor my work. 
							That said, the improvements were worth it. I’ll admit, I also repurposed this script for some <i>*ahem*</i> questionable intentions. 
							But hey, it worked, and I learned a lot from the process.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project was a turning point for me. 
							I had to repeatedly rewrite code to prevent unexpected crashes, which forced me to start understanding the value of clean and organized code. 
							It marked the beginning of me truly becoming a knowledgeable programmer.

							<h2>MilkyWaves (Python, JavaScript) 2020-2021</h2>
							<p>
								Music was starting to feel like it was coming together—or so I thought. After discovering <a href="https://poolsuite.net/">PoolSuite</a> (SICK radio station, CHECK THEM OUT), 
								I had an epiphany: since I make music, why not create my own radio station? 
								It seemed like the perfect blend of my passions for music and programming. 
								At the time, my <i>*cough*</i> other ventures were slowing down. 
								Expansion would have required taking risks I wasn’t willing to entertain. 
								I figured this was the perfect opportunity to focus on what I truly cared about.
							</p>
							<p>
								What I didn’t realize (again) was just how much time this project would take. 
								My knowledge of Python and HTML was pretty limited, but I dove in headfirst. 
								What followed were six months of grueling work—plagued by self-doubt, anxiety, and the ever-persistent impostor syndrome. 
								But, bit by bit, I made progress. And after months of trial, error, and perseverance, I finally brought the project to life.
							</p>
							<p>
								The concept was simple: the app downloads YouTube videos, converts them into MP3s, and serves them to listeners. 
								Fueled by my growing obsession with discovering new music, I created multiple stations for different genres, each with its own aesthetic and imagery.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the end, the project turned out to be a blast. 
								I learned so much, and the user interface is something I’m especially proud of—it perfectly captures the vibe I was aiming for.

							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
								<p>
									This was my first real project, and it required me to think about creating a product for users other than myself. 
									It was a steep learning curve, but I gained a significant portion of the skills I have today from this experience. 
									I learned <b>Django, React, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, AWS, HTML (in-depth), CSS, Celery</b>, 
									and fully committed to understanding object-oriented programming with classes.
								</p>
								<h3>Designing and Iterating</h3>
									<p>
										I planned the frontend design carefully, but it took two iterations to land on a design that worked. 
										Initially, my CSS was inefficient, and my images were unoptimized, which made for a poor user experience. 
										The performance issues forced me to rethink how I approached frontend development.
									</p>
									<p>
										React was particularly challenging. Coming from a background where asynchronous programming was unfamiliar, 
										I struggled to adapt. Web development inherently relies on threads, and integrating Celery was necessary for managing tasks.
									</p>
								<h3>Backend Development and APIs</h3>
									<p>
										Conceptualizing how models and views worked in Django took the longest. 
										Back then, I didn’t fully understand how servers processed requests or how Python packages fit together. 
										Once I cobbled together functions to retrieve YouTube playlists, download songs, and convert them to MP3s, 
										I faced the challenge of integrating them into a <b>REST framework</b>.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project introduced me to APIs, and as I grasped their fundamentals, the backend slowly started to come together. 
										Debugging and organizing the backend taught me the importance of clean and modular code.
									</p>
								<h3>Tackling the Frontend</h3>
									<p>
										The frontend was a different kind of uphill battle. 
										My initial approach was to use a class-based React component for the top-level structure because that was more common at the time. 
										I faced countless challenges with asynchronous programming—every small mistake felt monumental. 
										I didn’t know the common <i>"gotchas"</i> in React, and I struggled with using hooks in the right scenarios.
									</p>
									<p>
										At first, I wrote more errors than solutions, and the process was frustrating and demoralizing. 
										But over time, I learned how to efficiently retrieve, store, and manage data in React.
									</p>
								<h3>Reflection</h3>
									<p>
										This project tested me in ways I hadn’t anticipated. 
										There were many days when I felt completely stuck, but the perseverance paid off. 
										It gave me a deep appreciation for how applications are built and instilled a sense of gratitude for the journey I embarked on.

						<h2>GutBusters (Python, JavaScript) 2023-2024</h2>
						<p>
							The road gets pretty rocky from here, so let me provide some context. To cut a long story short, 
							I went off to make music for a year but found myself unable to complete the projects I envisioned. 
							Challenges like an unreasonable rent increase from the landlord and the sheer time and capital required to create songs 
							I could truly be proud of made it difficult to move forward.  
							</p>
							<p>
							In a bold move, my brother and I decided to take a risk—we bought a school bus and set out to renovate it ourselves. 
							We were way in over our heads, tackling a project of that scale. As a result, 
							I ended up homeless for about a year while the bus slowly came together. 
							Despite the overwhelming chaos of those times, I managed to utilize most of my free time productively—a fact I hold close to my heart and am immensely proud of.  
							</p>
						<p>
						</p>
						<h3>Enter Machine Learning and GutBusters</h3>
						<p>
							This period led me to explore machine learning, a field I had no prior experience with. 
							My math skills were decent, but I lacked knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and statistics—subjects critical for machine learning. 
							I decided to tackle a project called GutBusters, a sort of Netflix for stand-up comedy. Amidst the chaos, I had grown an affinity for stand up comedy, and I wanted to somehow share the joy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, machine learning proved to be a massive hurdle, especially given my unstable living situation and limited resources. 
							The hardware alone was a significant barrier, not to mention the time required to learn the necessary math concepts and implement the project.

							Ultimately, I decided to shelve <i>GutBusters</i> for a future version of myself—one with a more stable living situation and the resources to bring this vision to life.

			<!-- What You've Learned-->
				<section class="wrapper style1 align-center">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>What I Learned</h2>
						<p>
							Despite shelving <i>GutBusters</i> as a project, I didn’t give up on learning the skills necessary to bring it closer to reality. 
							I initially sourced many open-source facial recognition algorithms, which required me to dive deep into neural networks—a field inherently rooted in linear algebra.
						</p>
						<p>
							I spent months solving linear algebra problems, learning calculus, 
							and practicing exercises to better understand how the underlying code worked. 
							Along the way, I picked up tools and libraries like: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>NumPy</b> for mathematical computations.</li> 
							<li><b>OpenCV</b> and <b>Pillow</b> for image processing.</li>
							<li><b>PyTorch</b>, <b>TensorFlow</b>, and even <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> for prototyping and experimenting.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							There were moments of relief when I discovered some lightweight open-source software that helped streamline parts of the process. 
							However, I often found myself knee-deep in technical challenges. 
							For example, I had to compile OpenCV from source (Hello again, C++) 
							and experiment with various image recognition solutions to solve my primary issue: generating content optimized for phone screens.
						</p>
						<h3>Automating the Process</h3>
						<p>
							For an idea like <i>GutBusters</i>, the quality and presentation of content would make or break the app. 
							Hand-picking videos manually was impractical given my limited time and resources, so I sought to automate the process.
						</p>
						<p>
							I developed an algorithm to process MP4 videos, detect faces in every frame, 
							and crop the background around the face to fit a phone’s aspect ratio. Here’s how it worked:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I likely used <b>fastOCR</b> or a similar model for face recognition, drawing a green box around detected faces (I tried several models, so I might not remember the exact one).</li>
							<li>I used the <b>seam carving algorithm</b> for cropping, guiding it with the detected face's position to minimize distortion.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							While the algorithm was effective for many video types, it wasn’t perfect.
							 Warping was rare, thanks to seam carving, but the process was slow. 
							 A 30-second video could take nearly two minutes to process—almost four times the video’s length.
						</p>
						<h3>Optimising for Speed</h3>
						<p>
							I attempted to speed things up by leveraging <b>Numba</b> to parallelize the pixel-difference calculations across multiple processors. 
							While this helped, it wasn’t enough for scaling the solution. 
							Even with a powerful PC, the project was becoming increasingly out of reach for someone in my circumstances.
						</p>
						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>
							Despite these obstacles, I learned a tremendous amount about image processing, machine learning, and data optimization. 
							I even ventured into academic papers—something I’d found intimidating before—and studied the seam carving algorithm in depth. 
							The experience was transformative, giving me newfound confidence in tackling technical and theoretical challenges.

						<h2>ScrapCity (Python, TypeScript) 2023-Now</h2>
						<p>
							By this time, I was sleeping in my car. 
							The bus renovations were slowly coming along, but with limited resources, I had to get creative. 
							Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and OfferUp became my go-to sources for finding affordable supplies and tools. 
							My brother would stalk these platforms relentlessly, and I soon realized that building a programmatic solution to retrieve deals would be much more efficient.
						</p>
						<h3>The Web Scraper Project</h3>
						<p>
							I started working on a web scraper tailored to our needs. 
							While the project is still a work in progress, it has evolved into an invite-only tool where users input their preferences, and the scraper searches the web for matching deals. 
							The retrieved data is displayed in both a map layout and a list format.
						</p>
						<p>
							To make it portable, I used Cordova to package it into an Android APK. 
							Now, I use it on my phone to find great deals on products that fit my requirements.
						</p>
						<h3>Success with the Generator</h3>
						<p>
							One of my most notable successes using this app was finding a generator. 
							I met a super cool guy and bought a generator that had issues staying on. 
							I took a gamble and correctly assumed that the problem lay with the governor. 
							After a quick adjustment (two days of wrestling a rusty bolt!), I got a $500 generator working perfectly for only $140.
						</p>
						<h3>Future Plans</h3>
						<p>
							After using the scraper for a while, I realized that I still enjoy browsing websites due to their recommendation algorithms. 
							This has inspired me to think about integrating those kinds of insights into my tool, though it’s something I’ll tackle later.
						</p>
						<p>
							Right now, as of <b>12/29/2024</b>, my immediate priority is insulating and finishing the bus ceiling before summer hits. 
							Once that’s done, I plan to focus on wrapping up most of the scraper’s code and refining its features.

						<h2>What I Learned</h2>
						<h3>The Game-Changing Project</h3>
							<p>
								This project is one I’m incredibly excited about—it has the potential to truly change my life if I approach it the right way. 
								Over its development, I’ve learned how to leverage <b>multiprocessing</b>, optimize <b>databases</b>, work with <b>TypeScript</b>, develop <b>APIs</b>, and even tackle <b>graphic design</b>. 
								These skills, among others, have been invaluable in bringing this vision to life.
							</p>
							<p>
								Initially, the app was simple: it used JSON files to define preferences and sent a notification to your phone when a deal was found. 
								As the range of tools and supplies I needed grew, I realized the app needed a <b>GUI</b> and a robust <b>backend</b>. 
								Over the past year, I’ve slowly built this project alongside a host of other tasks, including installing solar panels on the bus, 
								repairing the air brake system, uncaging the spring brakes, and tackling various mechanical and construction projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								Back then, I couldn’t dedicate the 10-12 hour days necessary to rapidly develop the project. 
								But now, the bus has solar power, a sink, a bed, and a functional engine. 
								My living situation has stabilized enough to let me pour significant time into this work, and 
								I’m happy to say that the <b>backend</b> and <b>frontend</b> now have their fundamental implementations ready.
							</p>

							<h3>Challenges in Backend Development</h3>
							<p>
								Building the backend for this app has been a monumental task. I rebuilt it three times, facing countless hurdles along the way. 
								Early on, I didn’t use <b>Celery</b>, and operations were painfully slow—no one wants to wait more than 2 seconds for a task, much less 10 minutes! 
								Once I started using Celery, I rewrote the pipeline repeatedly to make both scraping and data analysis fast enough to be practical.
							</p>
							<p>
								Optimizing the scrapers for speed was another massive undertaking, but through persistence, 
								I’ve gotten <b>really good at web scraping</b>—I’d even say I’ve developed some trade secrets. 
								I also dove into <b>SQL</b> to build a powerful search bar and manage a large relational database of products. 
								Moving these databases from server to server was no small feat, and I learned so much about database management in the process.
							</p>
							<h3>The Frontend Journey</h3>
							<p>
								The frontend had its own unique challenges. 
								Integrating the <b>Mapbox API</b> required understanding geospatial systems and working with location APIs. 
								I learned a tremendous amount about JavaScript during this phase. 
								But as the project grew, I found JavaScript increasingly limiting and decided to migrate the entire codebase to <b>TypeScript</b>. 
								It was a painful process—I waited too long to switch, and it took nearly a week—but it was worth it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mapbox posed its own hurdles, particularly with placing multiple pins on the same coordinate. 
								I had to dig through GitHub, find a suitable solution, and then modify its source code to fit my use case. 
								(I ended up using and customizing <a href="https://github.com/Sarnes/map-gl-js-spiderfy">Mapbox Spiderfy</a>.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Optimizing the UI was another critical step. It’s a complex interface with many moving parts, 
								so I worked hard to ensure smooth performance by unmounting offscreen components dynamically. 
								While there are still a few rough edges in the UI, I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished. 
								The app is functional, efficient, and something I’m excited to use every day.
							</p>
							<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
							<p>
								This project has been a massive learning experience, from backend pipelines and database optimization to frontend interactivity and geospatial design. 
								It’s been a solo effort, but I’m super proud of how far I’ve come. 
								I’m excited to keep refining it and seeing how it can grow into something truly transformative.

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							From sleeping in my car to creating a functional, solar-powered living space in my bus, this journey has reshaped my perspective and instilled a deep sense of confidence in my ability to navigate challenges. 
							Every obstacle has taught me that growth often comes from making hard decisions and sacrificing what’s comfortable to build a fulfilling life for myself.  
						</p>
							<p>
							These accomplishments, while significant, are simply the groundwork for even greater things to come. 
							I am proud of the progress I've made, but I am well aware that there is ALOT more what needs to be done.
